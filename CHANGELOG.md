# Changelog

All notable changes to **Motion Core** will be documented in this file.
The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and the project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased]

## [0.14.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **1 component**:
  - **Navigation**: Underlay Navigation.

## [0.13.0] - 2026-05-30

### Added

- **1 component**:
  - **Canvas**: Glass Logo.

### Fixed

- **Canvas / Water Ripple**: Brush size changes now update the active OGL brush meshes immediately without requiring a preview remount or page refresh.

## [0.12.0] - 2026-05-13

### Added

- **1 component**:
  - **Typography**: Text Repel.

### Changed

- **GSAP / Components**: Scoped GSAP animations with `gsap.context()` and component-root cleanup across Flip Card Stack, Flip Grid, Floating Menu, Image Trail, Magnetic, Marquee, MacOS Dock, Preloader, Radial Gallery, Slideshow, Split Hover, Split Reveal, Stacking Words, Text Scramble, Video Player, Video Slider, and Weight Wave.

## [0.11.2] - 2026-04-26

### Fixed

- **Canvas / All**: Replaced `ResizeObserver` + `renderer.setSize()` with tick-based resize detection across all OGL Scene components. `renderer.setSize()` was overwriting `canvas.style.width/height` with fixed pixel values, breaking GSAP Flip animations by making the canvas go blank during layout transitions. Canvas buffer dimensions are now updated every RAF frame from `clientWidth`/`clientHeight`, keeping CSS layout fully in control.
- **Canvas / Fluid Simulation**: FBO resize is now debounced and only triggered when the canvas grows beyond the current FBO capacity — fluid state is preserved during and after GSAP Flip animations.
- **Canvas / Fluid Image Reveal**: Same FBO grow-only strategy as Fluid Simulation. Additionally, `uResolution` is updated immediately on every frame so cover UV proportions remain correct throughout resize animations.
- **Canvas / Fluid Simulation, Fluid Image Reveal**: Fixed a pre-existing warning ("Active uniform uTexel has not been supplied") caused by the splat vertex shader declaring `uTexel` while `splatUniforms` did not supply it.

## [0.11.1] - 2026-04-25

### Fixed

- **Canvas / Runtime**: Fixed live prop updates for OGL shader uniforms by avoiding deeply proxied Svelte state for runtime uniform objects.
- **Canvas / Infinite Gallery**: Updated `visibleCount` changes to rebuild gallery planes inside the existing WebGL runtime instead of requiring a component remount.
